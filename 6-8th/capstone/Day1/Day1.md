# INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE

# CAPSTONE PROJECT: DAY ONE

# OBJECTIVE
1. Setup our projects.
2. Using your Homework, we will begin to form the questions for our Trivia Game.

# PROJECT SETUP

1. What should we name our Project?
    * What I mean specifically, is what should we name our `.java` file.
    * Now, what should we name our class?
2. We will name our project TriviaGame, therefore our file will be named `TriviaGame.java` and the class will be named `TriviaGame`. Remember our filename and class name must match.
3. Soon we will introduce a new file named `Question.java` into our project which will be responsible for creating our questions.

# DELIVERABLE

1. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR TODAY'S CAPSTONE DEVELOPMENT, YOU WILL HAVE TO FINISH ALL STEPS BELOW. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET MY ATTENTION, TO CHECK YOUR WORK TO GIVE YOU CREDIT.

## ASSIGNMENT:
1. In the `welcome` method in our program, we will greet the users who are playing our game. You can greet them however you wish. **Be polite, be warm, be welcoming.**
    * Observe the example shown in class, and work on your own to create a `method` that displays a welcome message.
2. What `datatype` do you think we will be using to store our questions?
    * String? int? double? boolean?
3. Observe the example in class, it will show you how to create a question with an answer.

**Example:**
```java
String q1 = "How old is Mr. Bostwick? \n\n" + "[a] In his twenties\n[b] In his thirties\n[c] In his fourties";
```

In this example notice, our datatype is a `String` and the name of our variable is `q1`. The name of our variable will change as we add more questions to our program, and the `value` will change as well. Also, in this example you will see `\n`, in programing this is how we create a new line. In other words, this is how we bring text to the next line.

## ðŸš¨ Use the remaining time in class to build the rest of the variables needed to store your questions and answers. ðŸš¨
