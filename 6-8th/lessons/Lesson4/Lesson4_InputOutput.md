# WHAT IS INPUT? 
1. Input can take a variety of forms, from commands you enter from the keyboard to data from another computer or device. A device that feeds data into a computer, such as a keyboard or mouse, is called an input device. **The act of entering data into a computer.**

# WHAT IS OUTPUT?
1. Data generated by a computer is referred to as output. The most commonly used output device is the **computer's monitor**, which displays data on a screen. Devices such as the printer and computer speakers are some other common output devices.

# WHY IS INPUT AND OUTPUT IMPORTANT IN COMPUTER SCIENCE?
1. There are unlimited practical and real world examples/explanations supporting why input/output is very important in our programs.
2. It makes our programs `flexible`. Our programs can `adapt` to whoever is using it.
3. This makes the programs we build extremely personal and relatable.

# HOW DO I ENTER INFORMATION INTO MY PROGRAM?
1. We need to import the `Scanner` class into our program.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```
2. We create an object of the `Scanner` class and use it to get the input. `System.in` represents the keyboard.
```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
// Weeks ago we learned System.out is how we display information to the Terminal (the computer). That is how JAVA represents the Screen.
```
3. At this point, I connected my keyboard to the variable (Object) I declared named `input`.
4. How do we use `System.in` ? How do I enter data into my program?
### EXAMPLE
5. This program below will ask the user to input two numbers, and it will return the sum of those numbers.
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    // DECLARE 3 VARIABLES THAT ARE INTEGERS
    int number1, number2, sum;

    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.println("Enter the first number: ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    number1 = input.nextInt();

    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.println("Enter the second number: ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    number2 = input.nextInt();

    // ADD NUMBERS
    sum = number1 + number2;

    // DISPLAY THE SUM
    System.out.println("The sum is " + num);
  }
}
``` 
6. In this example, we use a method named `nextInt()` which lives on the `input` Object we declared above to accept an `Integer` from the user.
7. When the compiler (computer) gets to this line, it will `wait` for the user to enter a number then hit `Enter` to proceed.
8. At that point, the number the user inputted is stored in a variable we named `number1` or `number2`.

# NOTICE
1. We used `nextInt()` to get an `Integer` from our users.
2. How can we get a Fraction/Decimal from our users? What `datatype` do we use to store Fractions/Decimals? Now, what method do you think we can use?
```java
nextDouble();
```
3. What about `String`'s ?
```java
nextLine();
```

# HOW DO I DISPLAY INFORMATION I COLLECTED?
1. Very simply. We use `System.out`.
2. In the example above we used `System.out.println("The sum is " + num);`.

# SUPER DUPER COOL EXAMPLE
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class CoolExample
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // DECLARE OUR VARIABLES
    String name, present, yourName;
    int age;

    // DECLARE OUR VARIABLES THAT WILL CONNECT TO OUR KEYBOARD
    Scanner inputString = new Scanner(System.in);
    Scanner inputNumber = new Scanner(System.in);

    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.print("What is the name of the gift giver? ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    name = inputString.nextLine();
    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.print("What is the present they gave you? ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    present = inputString.nextLine();
    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.print("How old were you on your birthday? ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    age = inputNumber.nextInt();
    // PROMPT THE USER
    System.out.print("What is your name? ");
    // STORE ENTERED NUMBER IN VARIABLE
    yourName = inputString.nextLine();

    // OUTPUT
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Dear " + name + ", ");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Thank you for the " + present + ". ");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("I really like it. I can't believe I'm already " + age + " years old, but it doesn't feel that much different than being " + (age - 1) + ". ");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println("Sincerely, ");
    System.out.println();
    System.out.println(yourName);
  }
}
```

# NEXT WEEK: CAPSTONE PROJECT BEGINS
1. We will be creating a `Trivia Game`
2. What is a Trivia Game?
    * A game where the competitors are asked questions about interesting but unimportant facts in many subjects.
3. Correctly answered questions will reward 1 point (or whatever you decide).
4. Incorrectly answered questions will subtract 1 point (or whatever you decide).
5. At the end of the game (after all questions are answered), the user will see their score.

# HOMEWORK
1. In order to receive A Laptop to work on the capstone project in class, you will need to sign the Laptop Agreement Form. (if not, you will handwrite your project)
2. Brainstorm your Capstone Project:
    * What is the name of your game?
    * What will be the topic of your game?
    * What questions will you ask your users? (minimum of 6 questions)
    * How many points will you reward correctly answered questions?
    * How many points will you subtract for incorrectly answered questions?
